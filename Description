In Machine Learning or in Data Science regression is known to be one of the most 
crucial fields and thereâ€™re many regression methods available today. 

Linear Regression is one of them. whereas, regression is used to find the relationship among the variables.
Using the current data along with the income and year, we can predict the future income of any year using linear regression.

I am using the scikit-learn library to implement linear regression.

Linear Regression is a machine learning algorith comes from mathematical relationship 
Y=mX+c
where, 
Y=PREDICTIVE VALUE
m=iNTERCEPT (Which cuts a axis y)
X=Year of the prective value
c=slope of linear regression line .
